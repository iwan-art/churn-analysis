# Churn Analysis

Why customers are leaving? one needs to understand Human emotions and Customer Behaviour.

Investigate why Churn happens! Some of the reasons customers quit are:
- Negative experience with the business
- Poor product market fit
- Lack of great messaging and branding strategy
- Customer credit card expiring etc.

Churn becomes a hot topic for a business when the monthly recurring revenue (MRR) shows a significant fall. The MRR gets hit by two kinds of churn, _Customer Churn_ and _Revenue Churn_.

- _**Customer Churn**_: Also called Customer Attrition or Rate of Attrition is the number of customers who stop using a product or service in a given time frame.

- _**Revenue Churn**_: A sum of lost revenue, which could be due to downgraded subscriptions churned customers, or even a combination of both.

**Customer acquisition cost (CAC)** is something any business would incur during a business lifetime. It is usually 5x higher than retaining an existing customer!
Profitability comparison: Existing customer's profitability is about 60-70% while new customers drop by 5-20%.

Every healthy business understands that _acquiring customers comes with a cost_. CAC is the average cost incurred by the company to acquire a customer. So any price incurred to acquire a customer gets added to CAC.

**Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** is the average revenue earned by the company during the account lifespan before the customer churns.

- Which customers are leaving?
